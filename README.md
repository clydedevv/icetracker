# ICETracker

Community-driven, moderated map of reported ICE activity, inspired by `iceout.org`. This repo contains:

- `frontend` – React app (map, report form, dashboard)
- `backend` – Node/Express API (reports, moderation)
- `docker-compose.yml` – VPS-friendly setup (API, frontend, Postgres/PostGIS)

See the project README in `backend` and `frontend` for setup details.
